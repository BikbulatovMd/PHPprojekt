          <h2>The Lord of the Rings</h2>
          <p>
            The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by J.R.R. Tolkien, which was later fitted as a
            trilogy. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's earlier fantasy book The Hobbit, and soon developed into
            a much larger story. At publication, it was divided into The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and
            The Return of the King. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, with much of it during World War II, it
            was originally published in three volumes in 1954 and 1955. It has since been reprinted numerous times and
            translated into at least 38 different languages, becoming one of the most popular works of
            twentieth-century literature. The action in The Lord of the Rings is set in what the author conceived to
            be the lands of the real Earth, inhabited by humanity but placed in a fictional past, before familiar
            history but after the fall of his version of Atlantis, Númenor. Tolkien gave this setting a modern English
            name, Middle-earth, a rendering of the Old English Middangeard.

          <p>
            Tolkien offered The Lord of the Rings to Allen Publishing & Unwin. According to Tolkien's plan, the
            Silmarillion should have been published simultaneously with The Lord of the Rings, but the publishing
            house did not go for it. Then in 1950 Tolkien offered his work to the Collins publishing house, but an
            employee of the publishing house Milton Waldman said that the novel "urgently needs to be cut." In 1952
            Tolkien wrote again in Allen & Unwin. In particular, he wrote, "I will gladly consider publishing any part
            of the text." The publishing house agreed to publish the novel in its entirety and without "cuts".
            According to the contract, the author did not receive anything, but after the costs of publishing the book
            were paid off, the author received a significant share of sales. Due to the lack of paper in the post-war
            period, the publishers asked Tolkien to split the novel into 6 books with no titles. Then, for
            convenience, they were combined in pairs by the publisher into three parts, which were called the
            "Brotherhood of the Ring" (or "Commonwealth of the Ring" or "Guardians", Eng. The Fellowship of the Ring;
            books 1 and 2), "Two Fortresses" (or "Two Towers" or "Two Strongholds", Eng. The Two Towers; books 3 and
            4), and "The Return of the King" (or "The Return of the Sovereign" Eng. The Return of the King; books 5
            and 6, appendices). Tolkien himself was against the division of his novel into these parts and agreed to
            it only when no publisher agreed to print the whole book. The point here was both the lack of paper, and
            the reduction in the price of the first volume, and the evaluation of the success of the series. Due to
            delays in the creation of a map of Middle-earth and applications, the novel was printed only in 1954-1955.
            Three parts were published in England on July 29, 1954, November 11, 1954 and October 20, 1955, and
            somewhat later in the USA. The delay in the publication of the last part was caused, in particular, by
            disputes over its title. Tolkien did not like "The Return of the King" and he suggested calling this part
            "The War of the Ring", but the publishers resisted and insisted on their own version. Since then, the Lord
            of the Rings has been called a trilogy. Tolkien himself used this term, although in other cases he said
            that it was wrong. The novel was published by various publishers in one, two, three, six or seven volumes.
            The book was received by the public in different ways. In general, most of the reviews were positive, and
            Tolkien's colleagues at the Inklings club were simply delighted. John's friend, Clive S. Lewis, predicted
            that the book would outlive its time. At the same time, many newspaper critics noted conservatism and
            insufficient depth of characters. Critic Edmund Wilson noted that Tolkien's book would be better suited to
            a younger audience, rather than adults.

          <h2>Backstory</h2>
          <p>
            The back story begins thousands of years before the action in the book, with the rise of the eponymous
            Lord of the Rings, the Dark Lord Sauron, a malevolent reincarnated deity who possessed great supernatural
            powers and who later became the ruler of the dreaded realm of Mordor. At the end of the First Age of
            Middle-earth, Sauron survived the catastrophic defeat and chaining of his lord, the ultimate Dark Lord,
            Morgoth (who was formerly counted as one of the Valar, the angelic Powers of the world). During the Second
            Age, Sauron schemed to gain dominion over Middle-earth. In the disguise as "Annatar" or Lord of Gifts, he
            aided Celebrimbor and other Elven-smiths of Eregion in the forging of magical Rings of Power which
            conferred various powers and effects on their wearers. The most important of these were the Nine, the
            Seven and the Three (which he did not touch or know of the three.) called the Rings of Power or Great
            Rings. However, he then secretly forged a Great Ring of his own, the One Ring, by which he planned to
            enslave the wearers of the other Rings of Power. This plan failed when the Elves became aware of him and
            took off their Rings. Sauron then launched a war during which he captured sixteen and distributed them to
            lords and kings of Dwarves and Men; these Rings were known as the Seven and Nine respectively. The
            Dwarf-lords proved too tough to be enslaved, although their natural desire for wealth, especially gold,
            increased; this brought more conflict between them and other races, and fed a dangerous greed. The Men who
            received the Nine rings were slowly corrupted over time and eventually became the Nazgûl, Sauron's most
            feared servants. The Three Rings Sauron failed to capture, and remained in the possession of the Elves
            (who forged these independently). The war ended as Men of the island-kingdom of Númenor helped the
            besieged Elves, and Sauron's forces were practically destroyed. At this time he still held most of
            Middle-earth, excluding the coasts, Imladris (Rivendell) and the Gulf of Lune.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over 1500 years later, word reached the King of Númenor, Ar-Pharazôn, that Sauron had claimed the title
            "King of Men". This provoked Ar-Pharazôn and gave him an opportunity to display the glory and strength of
            Númenor. He arrived in Middle-earth with such overwhelming force that Sauron's armies fled at the sight of
            the Númenóreans. Abandoned by his minions, Sauron surrendered to the Númenóreans, and was taken to Númenor
            as a "prisoner". Sauron then started to poison the minds of the Númenóreans against the Valar. Thus,
            Sauron set into motion events that brought about Númenor's destruction. He did this by corrupting the
            King's mind, telling him that the immortality of the Elves was his to take if he set foot upon the lands
            of Aman, the Blessed Realm, where Valinor, the realm of the Valar, was located. Fearing death, Ar-Pharazôn
            led an invasion of Aman and Valinor with the greatest host seen since the end of the First Age. However,
            upon reaching Aman, he and his army were buried by a landslide, and there they would remain until the
            Final Battle in Tolkien's eschatology. Manwë, the King of Arda, called upon Eru Ilúvatar (God), who opened
            a great chasm in the sea, destroying Númenor, and removed the Undying Lands from the mortal world. The
            destruction of Númenor destroyed Sauron's physical body and his ability to take a fair and handsome shape,
            but his spirit returned to Mordor and assumed a new form: black, "burning hot", and terrible. Over 100
            years later, he launched an attack against the Númenórean exiles (The Faithful, who did not join
            Ar-Pharazôn's expedition), who managed to escape to Middle-earth. However, the exiles (led by Elendil and
            his sons Isildur and Anárion) had time to prepare, and, after forming the Last Alliance of Elves and Men
            with the Elven-king Gil-galad, they marched against Mordor, defeated Sauron on the plain of Dagorlad, and
            besieged Barad-dûr, at which time Anárion was slain. After seven years of siege, Sauron himself was
            ultimately forced to engage in single combat with the leaders. Gil-galad and Elendil perished in the
            struggle, and Elendil's sword, Narsil, broke beneath him. However, Sauron's body was also overcome and
            slain, and Isildur cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand with the hilt-shard of Narsil, and at this Sauron's
            spirit fled and he did not reappear for a millenium. Isildur was advised to destroy the One Ring by the
            only way it could be — by casting it into the volcanic Mount Doom where it was forged — but he refused,
            attracted to its beauty and kept it as compensation for the deaths of his father and brother (weregild).
            So began the Third Age of the Sun. Two years later, while journeying to Rivendell, Isildur and his
            soldiers were ambushed by a band of Orcs at the Disaster of the Gladden Fields. While the latter were
            almost all killed, Isildur escaped by putting on the Ring — which made mortal wearers invisible. However,
            the Ring slipped from his finger while he was swimming in the great River Anduin; he was killed by
            Orc-arrows and the Ring was lost for two millennia. It was then found by chance by a Stoor named Déagol.
            His relative and friend Sméagol strangled him for the Ring and was banished from his home by his maternal
            grandmother. He fled to the Misty Mountains where he slowly withered and became a disgusting, slimy
            creature called Gollum. In The Hobbit, set 60 years before the events in The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien
            relates the story of the seemingly accidental finding of the Ring by another hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, who
            takes it to his home, Bag End. Story-externally, the tale related in The Hobbit was written before The
            Lord of the Rings, and it was only later that the author developed Bilbo's magic ring into the "One Ring."
            Neither Bilbo nor the wizard, Gandalf, are aware at this point that Bilbo's magic ring is the One Ring,
            forged by the Dark Lord Sauron.

          <h2>Synopsis</h2>
          <p>
            The Lord of the Rings takes up the story about 60 years after the end of The Hobbit. The story begins in
            the first volume, The Fellowship of the Ring, when Frodo Baggins, Bilbo's adoptive heir, came into
            possession of Bilbo's magic ring. Bilbo's old friend, Gandalf the Grey, who got Bilbo involved in the
            adventures in The Hobbit that led to the discovery of the Ring, discovered that it was in fact the One
            Ring, the instrument of Sauron's power and the object for which the Dark Lord has been searching for most
            of the Third Age, and which corrupted others with desire for it and the power it held. Sauron sent the
            sinister Nazgûl, in the guise of riders in black, to the Shire, Frodo's native land, in search of the
            Ring. Frodo escaped, with the help of his loyal gardener Samwise Gamgee and three close friends, Meriadoc
            Brandybuck, Peregrin Took, and Fredegar Bolger. While Fredegar acted as decoy for the Ringwraiths, Frodo
            and the others set off to take the Ring to the Elven haven of Rivendell. They were aided by the enigmatic
            Tom Bombadil, who saved them from Old Man Willow and took them in for a few days of feasting, rest, and
            counsel. At the town of Bree, Frodo's party was joined by a man called "Strider", who was revealed, in a
            letter left by Gandalf at the local inn for Frodo, to be Aragorn, the heir to the thrones of Gondor and
            Arnor, two great realms founded by the Númenórean exiles. Aragorn led the hobbits to Rivendell on
            Gandalf's request. However, Frodo was gravely wounded by the leader of the Ringwraiths, though he managed
            to recover under the care of lord Elrond, the Half-elf. In Rivendell, the hobbits also learned that
            Sauron's forces could only be resisted if Aragorn took up his inheritance and fulfilled an ancient
            prophecy by wielding the sword Andúril, which had been forged anew from the shards of Narsil, the sword
            that cut the Ring from Sauron's finger in the Second Age. The treachery of Saruman, formerly head of the
            White Council and now in league with Sauron is also revealed. A high council, attended by representatives
            of the major races of Middle-earth; Elves, Dwarves, and Men, and presided over by Elrond, decide that the
            only course of action that can save Middle-earth is to destroy the Ring by taking it to Mordor and casting
            it into Mount Doom, where it was forged. Frodo volunteered for the task, and a "Fellowship of the Ring"
            was formed to aid him — consisting of Frodo, his three Hobbit companions, Gandalf, Aragorn, Boromir of
            Gondor, Gimli the Dwarf, and Legolas the Elf. Their journey took them through the Mines of Moria, where
            they began to be followed by the creature Gollum, whom Bilbo had met in the Goblin-caves of the Misty
            Mountains years before. (The full tale of their meeting is told in The Hobbit.) Gollum long possessed the
            Ring before it passed to Bilbo. Gandalf explained that Gollum belonged to a people "of hobbit-kind" before
            he came upon the Ring, which corrupted him. A slave to the Ring's evil power, Gollum desperately sought to
            regain his "Precious." As they proceeded through the Mines, Pippin unintentionally betrayed their presence
            and the party was attacked by creatures of Sauron. Gandalf battled an ancient demon, a Balrog, and fell
            into a deep chasm, apparently to his death. Escaping from Moria, the Fellowship, now led by Aragorn, go to
            the Elven realm of Lothlórien. Here, the Lady Galadriel showed Frodo and Sam visions of the past, present,
            and future. Frodo also saw the Eye of Sauron, a metaphysical expression of Sauron himself, and Galadriel
            was tempted by the Ring. By the end of the first volume, after the Fellowship has travelled along the
            great River Anduin, Frodo decided to continue the trek to Mordor on his own, largely due to the Ring's
            growing influence on Boromir; however, the faithful Sam insisted on going with him. In the second volume,
            The Two Towers, a parallel story, told in the first book of the volume, details the exploits of the
            remaining members of the Fellowship who aid the country of Rohan in its war against the emerging evil of
            Saruman, leader of the Order of Wizards, who wanted the Ring for himself. At the start of the first book,
            the Fellowship was further scattered; Merry and Pippin were captured by Sauron and Saruman's Orcs, Boromir
            was mortally wounded defending them, and Aragorn and the others went off in pursuit of the Hobbits
            captors. The three meet Gandalf, who has returned to Middle-earth as "Gandalf the White": they found out
            that he slew the Balrog of Moria, and although the battle also proved fatal to Gandalf, he was then sent
            back and "reborn" as a more imposing figure. At the end of the first book, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and
            Gimli help defeat Saruman's armies at the Battle of the Hornburg while Saruman himself was cornered by the
            tree-like Ents and Huorns, accompanied by Merry and Pippin, who escaped from captivity, and the two groups
            are reunited. The second book of the volume tells of Frodo and Sam's exploits on the way to Mount Doom.
            They managed to capture and "tame" Gollum, who then showed them a way to enter Mordor secretly (as opposed
            to the Black Gate), albeit through the dreaded realm of Minas Morgul. At the end of the volume, Gollum
            betrayed Frodo to the great spider, Shelob, and though he survived, he was captured by Orcs. Meanwhile,
            Sauron launched an all-out military assault upon Middle-earth, with the Witch-king (leader of the
            Ringwraiths) leading a fell host from Minas Morgul into battle against Gondor, in the War of the Ring. In
            the third volume, The Return of the King, the further adventures of Gandalf, Aragorn and company are
            related in the first book of the volume, while Frodo and Sam's are related in the second, as with The Two
            Towers. As told in the first book, the Fellowship assisted in the final battles against the armies of
            Sauron, including the siege of the city of Minas Tirith in Gondor and the climactic life-or-death battle
            before the Black Gate of Mordor, where the alliance of Gondor and Rohan fought desperately against
            Sauron's armies in order to distract him from the Ring, hoping to gain time for Frodo to destroy it. In
            the second book, Sam rescued Frodo from captivity. After much struggle, they finally reached Mount Doom
            itself, tailed by Gollum. However, the temptation of the Ring proved too great for Frodo and he claimed it
            for himself. However, Gollum struggled with him and managed to bite the Ring off. Crazed with triumph,
            Gollum slipped into the fires of the mountain, and the Ring was destroyed. Finally, Sauron was defeated,
            and Aragorn was crowned king. However, all was not over, for Saruman managed to escape and scour the Shire
            before being overthrown. At the end, Frodo remained wounded in body and spirit and went west accompanied
            by Bilbo over the Sea to Valinor, where he could find peace. According to Tolkien's timeline, the events
            depicted in the story occurred between Bilbo's announcement of his September 22, 3001 birthday party, and
            Sam's return to Bag End on October 6, 3021. Most of the events portrayed in the story occur in TA 3018 and
            TA 3019, with Frodo heading out from Bag End on September 23 3018, and the destruction of the Ring six
            months later on March 25, 3019.

          <h2>Frodo</h2>
          <p>
            Frodo Baggins, son of Drogo Baggins, was a hobbit of the Shire in the late Third Age. He is commonly
            considered Tolkien's most renowned character for his leading role in the Quest of the Ring, in which he
            bore the One Ring to Mount Doom, where it was destroyed. He was a Ring-bearer, best friend to his
            gardener, Samwise Gamgee, and was one of three hobbits who sailed from Middle-earth to the Uttermost West
            at the end of the Third Age.
          </p>
          <h4>Chilhood</h4>
          <p>
            Much of Frodo's youth was spent at Brandy Hall in Buckland, the ancestral home of the Brandybuck family,
            including his mother (Primula Brandybuck). Frodo was known as something of a rascal, befriending Meriadoc
            (Merry) Brandybuck and Peregrin (Pippin) Took and causing trouble wherever they went. They would often
            steal mushrooms from Farmer Maggot's farm Bamfurlong. In TA 2980, when Frodo was only 12 years old, his
            parents drowned in a boating accident on the Brandywine River. An only child, Frodo stayed in Brandy Hall
            until his 99-year-old "uncle" Bilbo adopted him in TA 2989. Bilbo took Frodo to live with him in his home
            at Bag End and made him his heir.The two grew very close in the following years; Frodo learned much of the
            Elvish language during his time with Bilbo, as well as much of the lore of Middle-earth. The two shared
            the same birthday, September 22 by Shire Reckoning (around September 12–14 of our calendar), and a party
            of special magnificence was held when Frodo came of age of thirty-three and Bilbo achieved the notable age
            of 111. Bilbo gave a memorable birthday speech before playing a joke on his fellow hobbits by using the
            One Ring to disappear, at which Gandalf quickly reacted and used his staff to create a blinding flash
            where Bilbo had been standing. The hobbits at the party were left confused and disgruntled, and Bilbo was
            never again seen in the Shire. Before departing for his journey to Rivendell, Bilbo had a long
            conversation with Gandalf, who finally persuaded him to voluntarily surrender the One Ring. Bilbo left it
            on the fireplace mantel with a note for Frodo, who would now become the next Ring-bearer.

          <h2>Bilbo</h2>
          <p>
            Bilbo Baggins was a Hobbit of the Shire, the main protagonist of The Hobbit and a secondary character in
            The Lord of the Rings. Gandalf suggested to Thorin and Company that they hire Bilbo Baggins to be their
            burglar in the Quest of Erebor, and later fought in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the
            bearers of the One Ring, and the first to voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote
            many of his adventures in a book he called There and Back Again. Bilbo adopted his
            second-cousin-once-removed Frodo Baggins to be his heir after his parents, Drogo Baggins and Primula
            Brandybuck, drowned in the Brandywine River.Bilbo was the first hobbit to become famous in the world at
            large, and one of the few to set foot in the Undying Lands.Bilbo Baggins was born on September 22 by Shire
            Reckoning (around September 12-14 of our calendar), in the year 2890 of the Third Age. He was the only son
            of Bungo Baggins and Belladonna Took. In Hobbiton, Bungo Baggins constructed a spacious and luxurious
            Hobbit-hole for Belladonna, which they named Bag End. The family moved to their new home, where Bilbo
            would spend much of his life.As a young Hobbit, Bilbo was curious and eager for news of the outside world.
            The Istar wizard, Gandalf, took interest in this unusual quality in Bilbo during his visits to the Shire.
            Bilbo would later remember Gandalf's Firework displays in the dwelling of his mother's family at Great
            Smials. Bilbo apparently practiced his rock-throwing skills in his youth so much, that birds and squirrels
            fled the area whenever he bent down to pick up a rock. When Bilbo's father and mother died in TA 2926 and
            TA 2934 respectively, Bilbo became his own master and spent the next seven years living alone in Bag End.
            During this time, Bilbo grew fond of his life as a wealthy bachelor and acquired a reputation for
            respectability that the neighbors admired.In the year TA 2941, Bilbo, at the age of 50, was visited by
            Gandalf, whom he had not seen for quite some time, outside his home at Bag End. Gandalf invited Bilbo on
            an unspecified adventure, which was flatly refused by the hobbit, who bade the wizard a "Good morning",
            and went inside. Undeterred, Gandalf continued in his plan, sending thirteen Dwarves, led by Thorin
            Oakenshield, to Bag End the very day. These Dwarves, needing an additional member for their company,
            initially came by pairs, and lastly with Gandalf, who had himself selected Bilbo as the best person for
            the Dwarves' job. The Dwarves explained to Bilbo their background and purpose; that they were among the
            Dwarves of Erebor who had been forced from the Lonely Mountain when the dragon Smaug attacked and taken up
            residence there. They now had determined to reclaim the mountain and needed a "burglar" to help them in
            situations requiring stealth. Bilbo reluctantly agreed to go, and the next morning they set off from the
            Green Dragon Inn.

          <h2>Gandalf</h2>
          <p>
            Gandalf the Grey, later known as Gandalf the White, and originally named Olórin (Quenya; IPA: [oˈloːrin]),
            was an Istar (Wizard), dispatched to Middle-earth in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He
            joined Thorin II Oakenshield and his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, helped form the
            Fellowship of the Ring to destroy the One Ring, and led the Free Peoples in the final campaign of the War
            of the Ring.riginally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar. He was created by
            Ilúvatar before the Music of the Ainur, and was at the beginning of Time amongst the Ainur who entered
            into Eä. In his "youth" he became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. He was
            associated with light and fire, much like Varda, yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he
            learned pity and patience. He loved the Elves, but walked unseen among them, or wore the guise of an Elf,
            and sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his life he followed the
            example of Nienna, talking pity on the sorrows of the Children of Ilúvatar and drawing those who listened
            to him out of despair.When the Valar decided to send the Istari (also called Wizards) to Middle-earth to
            counsel and assist all those who opposed the Dark Lord Sauron, Manwë and Varda included Olórin among the
            five to be sent. At first, Olórin was nervous and described himself as too weak and afraid of Sauron.
            Manwë understood, and told Olórin that such was a reason why he should go, to overcome that fear.
            Furthermore, the One Ring, containing much of Sauron's power, presumably still existed somewhere. Thus,
            Manwë insisted that Olórin should go as the third, but Varda convinced him to send Olórin as the second
            instead. He agreed, and prepared for Olórin's departure from the Undying Lands with the other four,
            arriving about the same time that the Necromancer appeared in Mirkwood.

          <h2>Sauron</h2>
          <p>
            Sauron (Quenya; IPA [ˈsaʊron] or [ˈθaʊron]), the eponymous Lord of the Rings, was the greatest subversive
            Maia, the maker of the One Ring, renowned student of the Vala Aulë, and the most trusted lieutenant of
            Morgoth. After Morgoth's ousting by the Valar, Sauron became the second Dark Lord and sought to conquer
            Middle-earth and even Númenor through guileful trickery - the chief representation of which were the Rings
            of Power - or overwhelming legions. At the end of the Second Age, Sauron was defeated in the War of the
            Last Alliance of Elves and Men united under Gil-galad and Elendil. In the final battle, Isildur managed to
            cut the One Ring from him, dismantling Sauron's corporeal form and ridding him of much of his power. After
            centuries lying dormant, rebuilding strength and stirring awake evil things, Sauron returned to power late
            in the Third Age, but was permanently crippled in the War of the Ring after the destruction of his Ring in
            the fires of Mount Doom by Frodo Baggins and his spirit was claimed by the Void.Sauron's original name was
            Mairon. He was the mightiest Maia of the Vala Aulë the Smith, and learned much from Aulë in the ways of
            smithing and handiwork, becoming a great craftsman, and "mighty in the lore of" Aulë's people. He was
            among the most powerful Maiar. During this time, Mairon was as Eru had created him: good and uncorrupted.
            His greatest virtue was his love of order and perfection, and dislike of anything wasteful. However, this
            would also prove to be the cause of his downfall, as Mairon saw in Melkor the will and power that would
            help him achieve his personal ends quicker than if he pursued them alone. However, while Melkor wanted to
            either control or destroy Middle-earth itself, Mairon's desire was to dominate the minds and wills of its
            creatures for what he perceived to be their own benefit. To see his marvelous designs through, Mairon
            sought to increase his innate power and this power in time became the end in itself; so he was ensnared by
            Melkor, entering his following and soon becoming his (self-centered) chief agent. After allying with
            Morgoth, Mairon maintained apparent fidelity to the Valar, but secretly fed Morgoth information of their
            dealings. It was only when Morgoth established his strongholds in Middle-earth that Mairon left Valinor
            and openly declared his allegiance, becoming a recognized foe of the Valar. Before Melkor's captivity,
            Sauron commanded the fortress of Angband and acted as his lieutenant. At the beginning of the Battle of
            the Powers, the Valar forces leveled Angband with little difficulty, though it is not known for certain if
            the demonic Maia was still present when the fortress was attacked. When Utumno was sacked and Melkor
            captured, Sauron was nowhere to be found, and in their haste to both capture the Black Enemy and remove
            him from Middle-earth, the Valar paid little heed to the latter's most terrible servants. The Sindar Elves
            in Beleriand called him Gorthaur, meaning "dread abomination",while others of the Eldar named him Sauron,
            meaning "the abhorred" or "the abominable" (a mockery of his original name).In the First Age, the Ñoldor
            Elves left the Blessed Realm of Valinor in the Utter West (against the counsel of the Valar) in order to
            wage war on Morgoth, who had stolen the Silmarils of Fëanor, enchanted gems that glowed with light from
            the now-destroyed Trees of Valinor. In that war, Sauron was counted as the "greatest of [Morgoth's]
            servants that have names" and was soon feared as a lord of phantoms and dreadful beasts - a shape-shifter,
            sorcerer, and cunning servant of his master. When Morgoth left Angband much later to corrupt the newly
            awakened Atani (Men), Sauron directed the war against the Elves. He conquered the Elvish isle of Tol
            Sirion, so that it became known as Tol-in-Gaurhoth, the Isle of Werewolves. He was the Lord of the
            Werewolves there, and Draugluin was the sire of the Werewolves. Sauron's herald was the vampire
            Thuringwethil. After the Dagor Bragollach in FA 456, Sauron's hunters brought Gorlim and interrogated him
            about Barahir's (father of Beren) location. Gorlim refused to tell them anything, even under torture,
            until Sauron himself came forth and bartered with the man. Gorlim asked for his wife Eilinel, whom he
            thought captured. Thus, Sauron agreed and Gorlim yielded the information. However, Sauron revealed that
            Eilinel was dead, and he put Gorlim to death afterward. During the Quest for the Silmaril, Beren and
            Finrod King of Nargothrond were captured by Sauron, who defeated Finrod in a duel with songs of power. He
            stripped them of their Orc disguises and cast them into the dark pits where werewolves devoured their
            companions. When a werewolf came to attack Beren, Finrod wrestled with and killed it, but died soon after
            of his injuries.

          <h2>Aragorn</h2>
          <p>
            Aragorn II, son of Arathorn II and Gilraen, also known as Elessar and Strider, was the 16th and last
            Chieftain of the Dúnedain of the North; later crowned King Elessar Telcontar (March 1, 2931 - FO 120), the
            26th King of Arnor, 35th King of Gondor and first High King of Gondor and Arnor since the short reign of
            Isildur. He was a great Ranger and warrior, and as Isildur's heir he bore the shards of Narsil, reforged
            and renamed Andúril, Flame of the West, in the War of the Ring. Aragorn was a descendant of Elros
            Tar-Minyatur through the line of the Lords of Andúnië to Elendil, High King of Arnor and Gondor. Like all
            of the kings before him, he is related to Elrond through the line of Elros. His ancestor Arvedui was
            wedded to Fíriel, descended from Anárion, who bore their son Aranarth, making Aragorn the last descendant
            of both Isildur and Anárion. When he was only two years old, his father Arathorn was killed while pursuing
            Orcs. Aragorn was afterwards fostered in Rivendell by Elrond. At the request of his mother, his lineage
            was kept secret, as she feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as
            the descendant of Elendil and Heir of Isildur became known. Aragorn was renamed "Estel" and was not told
            about his heritage until 2951.Elrond revealed to "Estel" his true name and ancestry when he was twenty,
            and gave to him the Ring of Barahir and the Shards of Narsil. Elrond withheld the Sceptre of Annúminas
            from Aragorn until he "came of the right" to possess the item. It was also around this time that Aragorn
            met and fell in love with Arwen, Elrond's daughter, newly returned from her mother's homeland of
            Lothlórien where she had been visiting her grandmother Galadriel. Aragorn thereafter assumed his proper
            role as the sixteenth Chieftain of the Dúnedain and left the comforts of Rivendell for the wild, where he
            lived with the remainder of his people, the Rangers of the North, whose kingdom had been destroyed through
            division and the Angmar Wars centuries before. Aragorn met Gandalf the Grey in 2956 and they became close
            friends. Heeding Gandalf's advice, Aragorn and the Rangers began to guard a small land known as the Shire
            inhabited by the diminutive and agrarian Hobbits, and he became known among the peoples just outside the
            Shire's borders as Strider. From TA 2957 to TA 2980, Aragorn undertook great journeys, serving in the
            armies of King Thengel of Rohan, and Steward Ecthelion II of Gondor. Many of his tasks helped to raise
            morale in the West and counter the growing threat of Sauron and his allies, and he earned priceless
            experience which he would later put to use in the War of the Ring. Aragorn served these lords in disguise
            and his name in Gondor and Rohan during that time was Thorongil ("Eagle of the Star"). With a small
            squadron of ships from Gondor, he led an assault on the long-standing Corsair city of Umbar in 2980,
            burning many of the Corsairs' ships and personally slaying their lord during the battle. After the victory
            at Umbar, "Thorongil" left Gondor and, to the dismay of his men, went east.

          <h2>Legolas</h2>
          <p>
            Legolas was a Sindar Elf who was part of the Fellowship of the Ring in the Third Age. Son of the Elvenking
            Thranduil of Mirkwood, Legolas was Mirkwood's prince, a messenger, and a master archer. With his keen
            eyesight, sensitive hearing, and excellent bowmanship, Legolas was valuable to the Fellowship in their
            journey across Middle-earth. He was well-known for becoming friends with the Dwarf Gimli, despite their
            long-held differences.Legolas came to the Council of Elrond in Rivendell, the great meeting held by the
            Elf lord Elrond, as a messenger from his father to discuss the escape of Gollum. When the council was
            choosing the "Nine Walkers" to pit against the "Nine Riders," Legolas volunteered to represent the Elves,
            and to become one of the members of the Fellowship that would set out to destroy the One Ring. During
            their journey, Legolas would stay at the rear due to his keen eyes. On Caradhras, Legolas was able to run
            nimbly over the snow, leaving behind little imprint, whereas his companions struggled to plough through
            it. When Gandalf gave his counsel, Legolas voted against passing through Moria. In the morning, the
            Fellowship was waylaid by Wargs and Legolas fought in their defence. After the battle, he picked up his
            arrows, save one which was damaged. Gimli quarreled with him in Moria (which was not unexpected
            considering the ancient quarrel between Elves and Dwarves) - Legolas' father Thranduil had once imprisoned
            Gimli's father, Glóin. He and Gimli became friends, however, when Gimli greeted the Elf, Lady Galadriel,
            with gentle words. Before the Fellowship departed from Lothlórien, Legolas was given a new Galadhrim
            longbow. While the Fellowship was travelling over the River Anduin, he used his new bow to shoot an
            overhead Nazgûl on a Fellbeast with one masterful shot in the dark. After the breaking of the Fellowship,
            Legolas and Aragorn sang a song of lament for the fall of Boromir. He then led the way as he, Aragorn and
            Gimli raced through Rohan after the Uruk-hai who had taken Merry and Pippin. During that week, he was
            given a grey horse named Arod, on which he and Gimli would often ride together, from Éomer and his Éored.

          <h2>Gimli</h2>
          <p>
            Gimli, son of Glóin, was a Dwarf of the House of Durin and a member of the Fellowship of the Ring. Unlike
            other Dwarves, he readily fought alongside Elves in the War of the Ring against Sauron at the end of the
            Third Age. After the defeat of Sauron, in the early Fourth Age, he was given the lordship over the
            Glittering Caves at Helm's Deep. Born in TA 2879, Gimli was the son of Glóin and a nephew of Óin, both
            former companions of Bilbo Baggins. He was a descendant of Durin the Deathless, father of the first house
            of the Dwarven people. Gimli was descended from, but was not a member of the royal line. Through his
            father, Gimli was also the first cousin once removed of Balin, Lord of Moria, and his brother Dwalin, two
            more former companions of Bilbo. It is also stated in Unfinished Tales that Gimli was prevented from
            traveling with his father on the Quest of Erebor because Thorin and Company thought him too young, though
            Gimli, being in his sixties, considered himself ripe for adventure and was disappointed to be left
            behind.In TA 3018, an emissary from Mordor approached the King under the Mountain, Dáin II, with offers of
            friendship and requests for news of a Hobbit bearing a Ring, as Sauron had become aware that the name
            Baggins was known to the Dwarf king. Not trusting the messenger, Dáin sent Glóin and Gimli to Rivendell to
            seek the advice of Elrond, and to warn Bilbo that the Enemy was seeking him. As a result, they were
            summoned to the Council of Elrond, where Elrond believed they would find the answers to their questions
            and would be able to contribute. Whilst there, Glóin told Elrond of the messenger and made reference to
            Balin, who had entered Moria and attempted to reclaim it. However, he had not sent any word to King Dáin
            II for over twenty years, and Glóin was concerned. The Council ultimately chose to send Frodo Baggins to
            Mordor to destroy the Ring and decided that a small fellowship should go with him. Gimli volunteered to
            accompany the Fellowship to Mordor to destroy the One Ring.

          <h2>Merry</h2>
          <p>
            Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck was a Hobbit of the Shire and one of Frodo Baggins cousins and closest
            friends. He loved boats and ponies and had a great interest in the maps of Middle-earth. He was also one
            of the nine companions of the Fellowship of the Ring, and later became the eighth Master of Buckland.
            Merry was born in TA 2982. He was the only child of Saradoc Brandybuck (TA 2940 - FO 11) the Master of
            Buckland, and Esmeralda Took (TA 2936 - ?), the younger sister of Paladin II Took. This made him first
            cousin to Paladin's son Pippin, who was also his closest friend. War of the Ring Merry was often
            considered the most perceptive and intelligent of the hobbits, for example, knowing of the One Ring and
            its power even before Frodo Baggins left the Shire. He guarded Bag End after Bilbo's party, protecting
            Frodo from the various and often unwanted guests. He also was the force behind "the Conspiracy" of Sam,
            Pippin, Fredegar Bolger and himself to help Frodo. Thus, even before the Quest of the Ring began, Merry
            was well prepared and organized; he assembled their gear and brought ponies. As a Brandybuck he also had a
            key to the gate in the High Hay. This shortcut through the Old Forest served them well, because they
            avoided the Black Riders and met Tom Bombadil, who helped them. At the Barrow-downs, Merry acquired his
            sword, a work of Westernesse.

          <h2>Sam</h2>
          <p>
            Samwise Gamgee, known as Sam, was a hobbit of the Shire. He was Frodo Baggins' gardener and best friend.
            Sam proved himself to be Frodo's closest and most dependable companion, the most loyal of the Fellowship
            of the Ring, and played a critical role in protecting Frodo and destroying the One Ring. Sam was the
            youngest son of Hamfast and Bell Gamgee, and had many brothers and sisters. A gardener by trade, Sam
            seemed to be a simple Hobbit of plain speech. However, his love for Elves, his gift for poetry, and his
            belief that the world contained greater wonders than most hobbits were aware of (all nurtured by his tutor
            Bilbo Baggins) set him apart from the beginning. It was Sam who first introduced (in J.R.R. Tolkien's
            novels) the theme of the Elves sailing from Middle-earth, a subtle foreshadowing of Bilbo and Frodo's
            final journey across the sea from the Grey Havens. He lived with his father, Hamfast Gamgee, known
            commonly as "The Gaffer", on Bagshot Row in the Shire, close to Bag End. He had five siblings: Hamson,
            Halfred, Daisy, May, and Marigold.As "punishment" for eavesdropping on Gandalf's conversation with Frodo
            regarding the dangers of the One Ring, Gandalf chose Sam to be Frodo's companion on his journey to
            Rivendell. Sam saved Frodo's life more than once during the quest to destroy the Ring, and would accompany
            him all the way to Mount Doom. After leaving Bree, Sam became very close to the pony Bill. On arrival at
            the Doors of Durin Bill had to be set loose as he could not pass through the Mines of Moria. This caused
            Sam great distress. In Lothlórien Sam was given a gift by the Lady Galadriel; a small box containing soil
            from her garden along with a Mallorn seed. After Shelob attacked and seemingly killed Frodo, Sam took the
            Ring, intending to complete the quest on his own. Because he held the Ring for a time, he was considered
            one of the Ring-bearers and during the time he possessed it the Ring tempted him with visions of a great
            garden all for himself. Being humble, Sam never gave into the treacherous visions and temptations of the
            the only ones ever to have given up the Ring willingly, and only Sam surrendered it readily.
